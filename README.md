# Crossplot Of Bezier curve project

After running the program at user-specified points, a Bezier curve is first drawn and then the crossplot of the given curve is drawn.

## Features included in the project documentation
* Mathematical description of the algorithm
* User guide and examples

## Key functionalities
* Add a new control point by left-clicking on the first quadrant
* Delete the last added point by right-clicking on the first quadrant
* After each addition or removal of a point, the Bezier curve is redrawn with the updated points
* Displaying and hiding the x(t) function by pressing the ‘x’ button on the keyboard
* Displaying and hiding the y(t) function by pressing the 'y' key on the keyboard
